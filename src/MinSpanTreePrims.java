/*
 *  Derive the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a complete graph.
 *  This implements an O(V**2) version of Prim's algorithm, where V is the
 *  number of vertices.
 *
 *  For a dense graph with arbitrary edge weights, this is the lowest
 *  complexity possible. We have to examine every edge, which number
 *  (V-1)(V-2)/2. For sparse graphs or complete Euclidean graphs, however,
 *  faster methods are available.
 *
 *  We don't care about the actual weights between vertices, only whether
 *  one edge weight is greater than another. Thus for Euclidean graphs we can
 *  use distances squared and avoid the time-consuming sqrt.
